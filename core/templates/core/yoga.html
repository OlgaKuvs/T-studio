                <p class="text-left">Our teaching centres on <strong>classical Hatha Yoga</strong>, coaching is carried out individually and in groups with a strong educational focus on the science behind the 
                    principles of practices. Group sessions suit relatively healthy people able to participate in a moderate range of movement.<br>
                    Individual yoga therapy is offered to those who's health is impaired allowing us time and space to develop a customized practice. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">Yoga encompasses a vast array of different practices, making it difficult to provide a concise definition. 
                    In brief, the word "yoga" in Sanskrit has numerous translations, some of which include:                    
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To bind, connect, sew, tighten, strengthen
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Union, alliance, combination, contact with something
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Concentration, focus (of thoughts), fixation (of an arrow on a bowstring), detached contemplation
                    </li>                                       
                </ul>
                <p class="text-left">In a liberal interpretation, one can say that yoga is the unification of parts into a whole. 
                    It can also be described as a body where many complex systems form a single living organism, ultimately leading to the union of oneself with the Absolute.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">In the modern world, there are numerous schools of yoga. Some adhere to traditions, 
                    passing on not only techniques but also the philosophy of yoga to their students. Others experiment with yoga according 
                    to their own preferences. Often, yoga transforms into a variety of fitness or interest-based clubs. 
                    By reducing the practice solely to the physical or, at best, the mental plane, they trim the wings of this tradition.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">If we turn to ancient texts in an attempt to trace the origin and development of yoga, 
                    we find numerous references to mystical yoga and wise men for whom practices from the eightfold path of yoga (Ashtanga Yoga) were commonplace.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">Understanding the history of yoga and its intricate ancient roots leads us to a more truthful and pure vision. 
                    This can help us engage in a more mature yoga practice in the 21st century.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">We primarily practice classical Hatha Yoga, consisting of the <strong>first four stages of the eightfold (Ashtanga) yoga</strong>:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Yama</strong> - principles of relationships with the external world
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Niyama</strong> - principles of individual discipline
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Asana</strong> - comfortable static body positions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pranayama</strong> - practice of exercises affecting the breathing cycle
                    </li>                                       
                </ul>
                <p class="text-left">These are followed by <strong>Dharana (concentration), Dhyana (meditation), and Samadhi (state of consciousness tranquility)</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">Understanding the history of yoga and its intricate ancient roots leads us to a more truthful and pure vision. 
                    This can help us engage in a more mature yoga practice in the 21st century.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left"><strong>What you gain from practicing yoga:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Significant improvement in the condition of the musculoskeletal system and internal organs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Balanced mental state
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Flexible and strong body
                    </li>                                                         
                </ul>
                <p class="text-left">Only regular practice will yield the necessary results for a quality life, awareness of changes in the body, 
                    and an attitude towards life. Through regular practice, you awaken a state of inner peace. Moving beyond perceiving asanas 
                    as a set of physical techniques, you begin to realize that yoga is something much greater.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">Yoga differs from simple physical exercises in that we are constantly (or aspire to be) in concentration: 
                    on breath, movement, understanding our capabilities. Additionally, leaving the mat, we bring this "state" into our everyday lives.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">In our practices, we guarantee:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Safety from injuries
                    </li>
                    <li>
