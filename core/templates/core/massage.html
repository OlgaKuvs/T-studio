                <p class="text-left"><strong>Medical Massage </strong> is not a specific type, technique, or school of massage. 
                    The name suggests to potential patients that in case of health problems, disorders, and diseases, 
                    they can turn to therapeutic massage as a method of treatment and expect not just temporary relief but long-lasting 
                    and stable positive results. Like any form of treatment, there are indications, limitations, and contraindications. 
                    Therefore, it is important for the patient to communicate their primary and accompanying conditions, so that after 
                    examination and the first session, a realistic prognosis for the expected treatment outcome can be provided.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">In each individual case, the technique of therapeutic massage will vary. 
                    I apply techniques from <strong>connective tissue, Swedish, trigger point, visceral, aromatherapy, 
                    and sports massage</strong>. If needed, I use a self-prepared massage oil blend, but in minimal amounts required.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">In addition to massage, post-isometric muscle relaxation and other techniques may be used. 
                    The duration of the massage can range from 5 minutes to 3 hours. The intensity is also individually tailored and usually 
                    increases from session to session. During the session, you may feel uncomfortable, and at times, even in pain. However, 
                    it will be a 'good' pain, and subconsciously, you will be confident that relief and improvement will follow. 
                    I make every effort to ensure that patients do not experience excessive pain during treatment, causing suffering. 
                    But you know â€“ no pain, no gain."
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">Some specialists attempt to distinguish between medical and therapeutic massages.  
                    This differentiation may make sense in countries where massage is employed as a treatment in hospitals and clinics 
                    as part of physiotherapy. Medical massage is considered more advanced, requiring specific education, qualifications, 
                    and certification. On the other hand, therapeutic massage just has a healing effect but is not as tightly regulated. 
                    In Ireland, there is no such distinction, and the terms "medical" and "therapeutic" massage can be used interchangeably
